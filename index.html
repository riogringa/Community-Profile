<p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<p>In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">new executive action</a> to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, affecting an estimated <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-many-37-million-unauthorized-immigrants-could-get-relief-deportation-under-anticipated-new"> 5.2 million people</a>. The programs, called expanded <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> (DACA) and <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a> (DAPA), will benefit some immigrants brought to the United States as children, as well as some undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.</p>
<p>Mexicans, who comprise the largest undocumented immigrant group in the country, stand to benefit the most in terms of absolute numbers. Plus, the majority of immigrants eligible for these programs live in just five states, with the largest population living in California.</p>
<p>But there's an important challenge. On February 16, a federal judge in Texas ordered a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/us/obama-immigration-policy-halted-by-federal-judge-in-texas.html?_r=0">temporary halt</a> to the new immigration policy. As this debate continues and as the government implements the new policy, it's important to look at who will ultimately benefit from the policy.</p>
<p><h2>How Many Latin American Immigrants Are Undocumented?</h2></p>
<p>Around <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Demographic,%20Educational,%20and%20Linguistic"> 80 percent</a> of the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States come from Latin America and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, about <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/latinos-america-demographic-overview">half of Latinos</a> living in the United States are undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>The largest groups of undocumented immigrants from Latin America hail from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>
<p class="text-center"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ONWoOqz"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ONWoOqz.png" width="65%" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
<p>The Pew Research Center <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/11/18/appendix-c-methodology-4/">bases its estimates</a> of the undocumented population on a residual estimation methodology using the American Community Survey and the March Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The Center subtracts the estimated legal population from the survey of total foreign born. The legal resident population is calculated using the Department of Homeland Securityâ€™s Office of Immigration Statistics.</p>
<p><h3>Living Among Us: The Geography of the Undocumented</h3></p>
<p>Close to half of undocumented U.S. residents live in Florida, Calfornia and Texas. But in several states - notably Nevada and New Jersey - undocumented immigrants make up a larger share of the state population. This is relevant given the fact that Nevada is part of the lawsuit against executive action, which New Jersey <a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2015/03/25/christie-obama-immigration-executive-order/70455932/">also joined</a> on March 25.</p>

<p><h3>Date of Arrival Matters for Executive Action</h3></p>
<p>Since 1980, the largest flow of undocumented immigrants - 28 percent - took place from 2000 to 2004. This is important, since <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction#daca">executive action will benefit</a> those who have continuously lived in the United States since at least January 1, 2010.</p>
<p>But around <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">22 percent</a> of undocumented immigrants have lived in the United States less than 5 years - making them ineligible for relief. This is especially relevant in the wake of the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/immigration/us-child-migrant-influx/p33380">Central American child migrant crisis</a> last year, when over 60,000 unaccompanied minors crossed the border.</p>

<p><h3>Latin Americans: The Main Target for Deportations</h3></p>
<p>While Latin American and Caribbean immigrants make up 80 percent of the undocumented population, they accounted for 98 percent of deportees during the last fiscal year, so deportation relief is especially important to this group. With executive action stalled, immigration enforcement authorities <a href="http://blogs.ilw.com/entry.php?8490-ICE-No-Longer-Honoring-New-Prosecutorial-Discretion-Memo">continue to target</a> those eligible for expanded DACA and DAPA. A <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/10/29/latino-support-for-democrats-falls-but-democratic-advantage-remains/">2014 Pew Hispanic study</a> found that a quarter of Latino adults personally knew someone deported or detained by immigration authorities within the past year.</p>

<p><h2>What Are the Requirements for Executive Action?</h2></p>
 <p>DACA began in 2012. Previously, there was a cutoff at age 31, and now there is no age restrictions. To qualify for <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">expanded DACA</a>, an immigrant must:</p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:square">
  <li>Have entered the United States before age 16;</li>
  <li>Have lived in the United States continuously since at least January 1, 2010;</li>
  <li>Had no lawful status on June 15, 2012;</li>
  <li>Are of any age (removes the requirement to have been born since June 15, 1981);</li>
  <li>Are currently in school, have graduated or obtained a certificate of completion from high school, have obtained a general education development (GED) certificate, or are an honorably discharged veteran of the Coast Guard or Armed Forces;</li>
  <li>Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor,or three or more other misdemeanors, and do not otherwise pose a threat to national security or public safety.</li>
</ul> 
<p><h4>Estimated number of eligible immigrants: 1.5 million</h4></p>
<p>DAPA is a <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">new program</a>. To qualify, an immigrant must:</p>
 <ul style="list-style-type:square">
<li>Have lived in the United States continuously since January 1, 2010;</li>
<li>Had, on November 20, 2014, a son or daughter who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident;</li>
<li>Are not an enforcement priority for removal from the United States under the <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/14_1120_memo_prosecutorial_discretion.pdf">new DHS memorandum</a>. (One cannot have committed a serious crime, multiple misdemeanors, a DUI, or have received a deportation order since January 2014.)</li>
</ul>
<p><h4>Estimated number of eligible immigrants: 3.71 million</h4></p>
<p class="text-muted"><cite>Source: <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-many-37-million-unauthorized-immigrants-could-get-relief-deportation-under-anticipated-new">Migration Policy Institute,</a> using an analysis of the 2008-2012 American Community Survey and the 2008 Survey of Income Program Participation.</cite></p> 
<p class="text-center"><iframe src="http://e.infogr.am/undocumented_immigrants_eligible_for_executive_action?src=embed" width="550" height="739"></iframe></p>
<p><h2>Who Is Eligible for Executive Action?</h2></p>
<p>Overall, around <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-many-37-million-unauthorized-immigrants-could-get-relief-deportation-under-anticipated-new">3.71 million people</a> are eligible for DAPA, and another 1.5 million are eligible for DACA (both the old and expanded program).</p>
<p>A majority of those eligible for executive action live in just five states. This matters because 14 states and the District of Columbia joined the federal government in <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/agportal-s3bucket/uploadedfiles/Home/News/Press_Releases/2015/15-40238+Brief+of+Amicus+States.pdf">appealing the injunction</a> holding up executive action.</p>
<p>These states - including California, Illinois, and New York - are fighting the injunction and arguing that it should not apply to them. This could potentially open the door to implementing the policy if the injunction is lifted in just those states. Notably, these states make up about 50 percent of the eligible population in the country. In parts of <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/imm/html/deferred/deferred-action.shtml">New York</a> and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-supervisors-immigration-20150224-story.html">California</a>, local governments are already preparing to implement executive action as soon as the injunction is lifted.</p>
<p>Notably, Texas â€“ which has one of the countryâ€™s largest undocumented populations - is the state <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/26/states-lawsuit-immigration_n_6550840.html">leading the lawsuit</a> against executive action.</p>

<p><h3>Latin Americans Eligible for Relief</h3></p>
<p>The group that will benefit the most based on absolute numbers is Mexicans. Around 3.2 million - or 55 percent of the undocumented population - will be eligible. The other largest groups to benefit are Salvadorans and Guatemalans. Proportionally, Haitians stand to benefit the most: around 68 percent of undocumented Haitians are eligible for relief.</p>
<p class="text-center"><iframe src="http://e.infogr.am/eligible_for_deportation_relief?src=embed" width="800" height="906"></iframe></p>
<p><h3>Who's Left Out?</h3></p>
<p>Around <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/">6.2 million immigrants</a> will be left out of the deportation relief policy.</p>
<p>In terms of Latin Americans, the biggest proportion of Brazilian immigrants will be left out, with nearly 70 percent ineligible for executive action. Dominicans are the second largest left-out group, with about two-thirds ineligible.</p>
<p class="text-center"><a href="http://i.imgur.com/BRX8ss9"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/BRX8ss9.png" width="65%" title="source: imgur.com" /></a></p>
<p><h3>Mixed-Status Families at Risk</h3></p>
<p>The new executive action excludes parents of immigrants who qualify for deferred action, which means that the phenomenon of "<a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DrebyImmigrationFamilies_execsumm.pdf">mixed status</a>" families - those who have some members at risk of deportation - will continue to be an important issue that can potentially mean more separations.</p>
<p>The Migration Policy Institute <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">estimates</a> that nearly 40 percent of undocumented immigrants have at least one child under 18. A large majority of undocumented parents live with at least one U.S. citizen child, meaning that they could potentially qualify for DACA.</p>
