<h1>Relief for 5 Million Immigrants: Who's Affected by Obama's Executive Action</h1>
<p class="lead">Immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean made up 98 percent of deportees during the last fiscal year, so deportation relief is especially important to this group. Mexicans, who encompass the largest undocumented immigrant group in the country, stand to benefit the most in terms of absolute numbers. The majority of immigrants eligible for these programs live in just five states, with the largest population living in California. </p>

<p><h2></h2>Introduction</h2></p>
<p>In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/immigration/immigration-action">new executive action</a> to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, affecting an estimated <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-many-37-million-unauthorized-immigrants-could-get-relief-deportation-under-anticipated-new"> 5.2 million people</a>. The programs—called expanded<a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals</a> and    <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction">Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents</a>—will benefit some immigrants brought to the United States as children, as well as some undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.</p>
<p>But there's an important challenge. On February 16, a federal judge in Texas ordered a    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/us/obama-immigration-policy-halted-by-federal-judge-in-texas.html?_r=0">temporary halt</a> to the new immigration policy. As this debate continues and as the government implements the new policy, it's important to look at who will ultimately benefit from the policy.</p>
<p><h2></h2>How Many Latin American Immigrants Are Undocumented?</h2></p>
<p>Around <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/frequently-requested-statistics-immigrants-and-immigration-united-states#Demographic,%20Educational,%20and%20Linguistic"> 80 percent</a>
of the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States come from Latin America and the Caribbean. Meanwhile, about    <a href="http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/latinos-america-demographic-overview">half of Latinos</a> living in the United States are undocumented immigrants.
</p>
<p>
    <em>First chart shows the percentage, illustrated, of Latin American immigrants by immigration status –PEDRO</em>
    <em></em>
</p>
<p>
    The largest groups of undocumented immigrants from Latin America hail from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ONWoOqz.png">http://i.imgur.com/ONWoOqz.png</a>
</p>
<p>
    Close to half of undocumented Latin American immigrants live in just California, Texas, and Florida. But as part of the overall population, Nevada has the
    highest rate of undocumented immigrants.

<p>
    <strong>Undocumented Immigrants in the U.S.: Age and Arrival Year </strong>
</p>
<p>
In 2012, over half of undocumented immigrants were young adults: 34 years old or younger, according to the    <a href="http://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/ois_ill_pe_2012_2.pdf">Department of Homeland Security</a>.
</p>
<p>
    To <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">qualify for DACA</a>, immigrants must have come to the
    U.S. before turning 16, but must also prove that they are in school, have a high school diploma or GED, or have served in the armed forces.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Another, this one a pyramid-shaped, to better visualize undocumented immigrant population by age (PEDRO)</em>
</p>
<p>
Since 1980, the largest flow of undocumented immigrants—28 percent—took place from 2000 to 2004. This is important, since    <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/immigrationaction#daca">executive action will benefit</a> those who have continuously lived in the United States since at
    least January 1, 2010.
</p>
<p>
    But around <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">22 percent</a> of undocumented immigrants have lived in the
United States less than 5 years—making them ineligible for relief. This is especially relevant in the wake of the    <a href="http://www.cfr.org/immigration/us-child-migrant-influx/p33380">Central American child migrant crisis</a> last year, when over 60,000 unaccompanied
    minors crossed the border.

    <a name="user-content-who-is-eligible-for-executi"></a>
    <strong>Who Is Eligible for Executive Action?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Overall, around
    <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/news/mpi-many-37-million-unauthorized-immigrants-could-get-relief-deportation-under-anticipated-new">
        3.71 million people
    </a>
    are eligible for DAPA, and another 1.5 million are eligible for DACA (both the old and expanded program).
</p>
<p>
    A majority of those eligible for executive action live in just five states. This matters because 14 states and the District of Columbia joined the federal
    government in
    <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/agportal-s3bucket/uploadedfiles/Home/News/Press_Releases/2015/15-40238+Brief+of+Amicus+States.pdf">
        appealing the injunction
    </a>
    holding up executive action.
</p>
<p>
    These states—including California, Illinois, and New York—argue the injunction should not apply to them, which could potentially open the door to
    implementing the policy in just those states. Notably, these states make up about 50 percent of the eligible population in the country.
</p>
<p>

    </a>
</p>
<p>
    With regards to Latin Americans, the group that will benefit the most based on absolute numbers is Mexicans. Around 3.2 million—or 55 percent of the
    undocumented population—will be eligible. The other largest groups to benefit are Salvadorans and Guatemalans.

    <a href="https://infogr.am/eligible_for_deportation_relief">https://infogr.am/eligible_for_deportation_relief</a>
</p>
<p>
    Proportionally, Haitians stand to benefit the most: around 68 percent of undocumented Haitians are eligible for relief.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="user-content-whos-left-out"></a>
    <strong>Who's Left Out?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Around <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/19/your-complete-guide-to-obamas-immigration-order/">6.2 million immigrants</a>
    will be left out of the deportation relief policy.
</p>
<p>
    In terms of Latin Americans, the biggest proportion of Brazilian immigrants will be left out, with only 31 percent eligible for executive action.
    Dominicans are the second largest left-out group, with only a third eligible.

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mixed-Status Families </strong>
</p>
<p>
The new executive action excludes parents of immigrants who qualify for deferred action, which means that the phenomenon of "    <a href="https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/DrebyImmigrationFamilies_execsumm.pdf">mixed status</a>" families—those who have some
    members at risk of deportation—will continue to be an important issue that can potentially mean more separations.
</p>
<p>
    The Migration Policy Institute <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">estimates</a> that nearly 40 percent of
    undocumented immigrants have at least one child under 18. A large majority of undocumented parents live with at least one U.S. citizen child, meaning that
    they could potentially qualify for DACA.

    <strong>Undocumented Immigrants Living in Poverty</strong>
</p>
<p>
Nearly a third of the undocumented—about 3.4 million people—live    <a href="http://migrationpolicy.org/data/unauthorized-immigrant-population/state/US">below the poverty line</a>, while around 18 percent live at or up to
    49 percent above the poverty line.
</p>
<p>
The costs involved with immigration are high. Currently, DACA costs    <a href="http://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/consideration-deferred-action-childhood-arrivals-daca">$465</a> to apply. Lawyers can cost thousands of dollars,
and bonds to get out of immigration detention    <a href="http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/immigration-detention-101-information-detainees-family-friends.html">range from $1,500 to $20,000</a>.
</p>
<p>
    DACA and DAPA immigrants can apply for <a href="http://www.nilc.org/dapa&amp;daca.html">work authorization</a>, which can lead to better jobs and higher
    incomes.

<p>
    <strong>Deportations of Latin American Immigrants</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Obama’s executive action could protect some 5 million people from deportation. But with executive action stalled, immigration enforcement authorities
    continue to target those eligible for expanded DACA and DAPA.
</p>
<p>
    While Latin American and the Caribbean immigrants make up 80 percent of the undocumented population, 98 percent of deportees in fiscal year 2014 came from
this region. A    <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/2014/10/29/latino-support-for-democrats-falls-but-democratic-advantage-remains/">2014 Pew Hispanic study</a> found that
    a quarter of Latino adults personally knew someone deported or detained by immigration authorities within the past year.
