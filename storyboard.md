# **Title**: 
6.2 Million Left out: Who's Affected by Obama's Executive Action on Immigration

*The president's plan helps more than half of undocumented Mexicans living in the U.S., it leaves out bigger portions of immigrants from South America and the Caribbean.*

# Introduction

In November 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama announced new executive action to protect undocumented immigrants from deportation, affecting an estimated 5 million people. The program will expand deferred action for immigrants brought to the United States as children, and will benefit undocumented parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents.

But there's an important challenge. As the new policy is set to go into effect, some Republican congressmen are trying to defund the new policy within the Department of Homeland Security budget. Plus, on February 16, a federal judge in Texas ordered a temporary halt to the new immigration policy. As this debate continues and as the government implements the new policy, it's important to look at who will ultimately benefit.

## Who's Left Out?

Around 6.2 million immigrants will be left out of the deportation relief policy. With regards to Latin Americans, the plan will help more than half of undocumented Mexican immigrants, but it leaves out large portions of undocumented immigrants from South America and the Caribbean.

The new executive action excludes parents of immigrants who qualify for deferred action, which means that the phenomenon of "mixed status" families--those who have some members at risk of deportation--will continue to be an important issue that can potentially mean more separations. The policy also doesn't include those who arrived less than 5 years ago. This is especially relevant in the wake of the Central American child migrant crisis last year.

## Historical and Economic Context of Executive Action

This isn't the first time a president has taken executive action on immigration. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan offered amnesty to 3 million immigrants. While Obama's policy doesn't go this far, it will offer deportation relief for up to 4 million immigrants--assuming the policy clears the legal hurdles it's currently facing. Plus, executive action has the potential for economic benefits. A North American Integration and Development Center report found that offering deferred action to parents of U.S. citizen and legal resident children would lead to $2.5 billion in new tax tax revenue. (Undocumented immigrants already pay almost $11 billion in state and local taxes.) The President's Council of Economic Advisers estimates the new policies as a whole will grow the country's GDP by $90 billion to $210 billion over the next decade.
